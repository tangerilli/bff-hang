- [x] Add a "copy" button to the share link, allowing users to click and have the link added to their clipboard
- [x] Change the "Only days matter for this poll. Pick every day you are free" copy to just read "Pick every day you are free"
- [x] On the homepage, at the bottom of the list of dates to choose from, add a button to add additional dates (if a user wants to select more than what's available by default). Each time the user clicks the button it should add an additional 14 days
- [x] When creating a poll, add a field for the creator to set their name as well, so that they can be displayed in the list of people available for each day
- [x] If possible, make the app hot-reload for local development, so that changes to at least the HTML files, and ideally the .go files, are picked up and incorporated without having to restart the server
- [x] Change the "Add 14 more days" copy to be just "More days"
- [x] Change the behaviour on the poll page so that after a user clicks "Save availability", they can change their availability and clicking "Save availability" again edits their previous selections, rather than adding a new entry
- [x] When a user visits the poll page (even the poll creator) redirect them to a URL that is specific to them for that poll. Then, if they have already submitted their availability, the availability form should be pre-populated with the selections they made previously (so they can update/edit them). Basically, we want a user system, but without creating actual users, instead the "user" is based on the URL
- [x] To continue improving on the last item, store a cookie in the users browser that links a poll id with their user-specific URL. Then, if a user visits the generic poll URL, they can be redirected to their user-specific URL automatically (as long as they're using the same browser they were previously using)
- [x] When the poll creator visits their user-specific URL, give them the ability to delete the responses for a given user
- [x] When the poll creator visits their user-specific URL, give them the ability to change the dates that are possible to select from
- [x] The "BFF Hang" text in the top left corner of the poll page should be a link to the apps homepage
- [x] The "Share this link so friends can respond." text is in the wrong place, it should be above the "Share Link" box, but right now it's over on the left hand side of the page, not particularly close to the "Share Link" box
- [x] If a user visits an invalid poll URL, instead of an empty 404 page, they should be redirected to the homepage, with a message at the top saying that the link they followed was invalid
- [x] When editing available dates as the poll creator, right now it only displays the dates that are selected (with an option to add 14 more days after). It should instead display all dates (i.e. the same list of dates as on the homepage when creating a new poll) so that you can add dates in between the ones that are already selected
- [x] Create a Makefile for building and deploying the app to lambda
- [x] Clean up the git status by adding a .gitignore file for artifacts that don't need to be tracked (for example zip files created by the deployment process)
- [x] Create a simple stats page (maybe located at /admin/stats) that displays how many polls have been created in the system, and how many responses to polls have been submitted
- [x] Deleting a response in production doesn't work, it displays "unable to delete response"
